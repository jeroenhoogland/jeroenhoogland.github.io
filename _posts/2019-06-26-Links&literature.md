Just trying to tidy up my browser and prevent further piling of open tabs of 'things to do'...

## Survival 

Paul Lambert has a nice [website](https://pclambert.net) that includes 
[interactive graphs](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/) on for instance splines 
([number and location of knots](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/spline_eg/spline_eg)) and 
[mixture Weibull distributions](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/mixture_weibull/mixture_weibull).

Some R code for modeling with left truncated and right/interval censored data [link](http://blogs2.datall-analyse.nl/2016/02/19/rcode_left_truncated_censored_data/#more-294) including the likelihood definition and ``optim`` routine. 

Using L_BFGS-B to fit a Weibul model (includes gradient) [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39747569/r-optim-l-bfgs-b-needs-finite-values-of-fn-weibull)

Furthermore
* [Large-Scale Parametric Survival Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3796130/#APP1) on regularized parametric survival modeling
* [Multilevel mixed effects parametric survival analysis](https://www.stata.com/meeting/uk13/abstracts/materials/uk13_crowther.pdf), a lecture by Michael Crowther
* A review on [Survival analysis with high-dimensional covariates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4806549/) by Witten and Tibshirani


## Subgroup analysis based on RCT data

A comparison of several approaches to predict most beneficial treatment class (Elastic Net, ridge-regularized Cox proportional hazards model, RandomForest, linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), [Predictive Analysis of Clinical Trials](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pact)) [link](https://doi.org/10.1101/338996)


## Regularization

* Trevor Hastie's [website](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/index.html) contains an [overview](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/swData.htm) of some useful R packages he's worked on including ``gamsel``, ``glinternet``, and ``glmnet``.

* [grpreg](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/grpreg/grpreg.pdf) package by Patrick Breheny
* Solving ridge for a linear model based on just least squares [whuber](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/69205/how-to-derive-the-ridge-regression-solution)
* Hand coding of penalized logistic regression in R [link](https://datascienceplus.com/logistic-regression-regularized-with-optimization/) and/or [link](http://pingax.com/logistic-regression-r-step-step-implementation-part-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=logistic-regression-r-step-step-implementation-part-2)

## Generalized additive modeling
Simon Wood's [website](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/) contains links to a (free) [Core Statistics book](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/core-statistics.pdf) and info on his new 2nd edition of 'Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R' ([errata](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/igam/errata.pdf) and sotware changes affecting its content). He also has slides for a lecture on [GAMs, GAMMs and other penalized GLMs using mgcv in R](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/talks/gam-mgcv.pdf) online.


## Matching

## Splines
The [splines2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/splines2/vignettes/splines2-intro.html) provides functions constructing B-splines, integral of B-splines, monotone splines (M-splines) and its integral (I-splines), convex splines (C-splines), and their derivatives.


## Optmization
