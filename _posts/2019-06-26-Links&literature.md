Just trying to tidy up my browser and prevent further piling of open tabs of 'things to do'...

## Survival 

Paul Lambert has a nice [website](https://pclambert.net) that includes 
[interactive graphs](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/) on for instance splines 
([number and location of knots](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/spline_eg/spline_eg)) and 
[mixture Weibull distributions](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/mixture_weibull/mixture_weibull).
