Just trying to tidy up my browser and prevent further piling of open tabs of 'things to do'...

## Survival 

Paul Lambert has a nice [website](https://pclambert.net) that includes 
[interactive graphs](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/) on for instance splines 
([number and location of knots](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/spline_eg/spline_eg)) and 
[mixture Weibull distributions](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/mixture_weibull/mixture_weibull).


## Regularization
Trevor Hastie's [website](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/index.html) contains an [overview](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/swData.htm) of some useful R packages he's worked on including ``gamsel``, ``glinternet``, and ``glmnet``. 


## Generalized additive modeling
Simon Wood's [website](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/) contains links to a (free) [Core Statistics book](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/core-statistics.pdf) and info on his new 2nd edition of 'Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R' ([errata](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/igam/errata.pdf) and sotware changes affecting its content). He also has slides for a lecture on [GAMs, GAMMs and other penalized GLMs using mgcv in R](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/talks/gam-mgcv.pdf) online.
